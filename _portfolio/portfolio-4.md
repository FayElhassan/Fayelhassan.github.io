For the [Sankofa Initiative Stream: What is at Hand?](https://memealameen09.wixsite.com/sankofa-initiative) project,where i as well serve as the Chair of the Communication and Documentation Committee. I took on the full responsibility for designing and developing the website, improving its usability and functionality to better serve students and communities. Utilizing modern web development tools, I created an engaging user experience with seamless navigation, ensuring the layout is visually appealing and responsive across all devices.

Through the Sankofa Initiative, our goal is to introduce children in underserved communities to the foundational concepts of Science, Technology, Reading, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STREAM) in ways that connect with their daily lives and cultural contexts. By doing so, we aim to make a lasting impact not only on the students but also on their families and the wider community.
