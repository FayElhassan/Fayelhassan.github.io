In this conference proceedings talk, I discussed two of my published papers focused on addressing the challenges of rural electrification in Sudan. 

### An Economic Evaluation of Islanded Microgrids Implementation in Northern Kordofan State
Published in ICCCEEE, 2021, this research introduces a solution for improving Sudan's inadequate electricity supply. It focuses on unconnected electricity grid users and discusses the economic aspects of connecting rural regions to Sudan's national grid.


### Enhancing Energy Trading Between Different Islanded Microgrids
Also published in ICCCEEE, 2021, this paper tackles the challenge of rural electrification in Sudan, focusing on the energy trading between different islanded microgrids.
