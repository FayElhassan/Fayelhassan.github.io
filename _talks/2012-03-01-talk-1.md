In this talk, I explore the multi-faceted vulnerabilities that women face, not just in Sudan but globally. I highlight how, particularly in Sudan, many societal structures often silence women's voices. I share personal experiences to illustrate the profound impact this has on women's ability to express themselves and make independent decisions.

I stress the importance of self-definition and urge women to evaluate their worth from their own perspective, rather than relying on societal judgments. I counter the traditional wisdom that "silence is the best answer for all questions" and "a smile is the best reaction to all situations," arguing that these adages do not apply in the context of the Sudanese community.

I am passionate about showcasing the diverse skill sets of Sudanese women across different sectors. I firmly believe that women can not only be the solution in many scenarios but also hold the key to many more.

This talk was delivered at a TEDx event, following the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. You can watch the full talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pfWImQaf_g).
