For the [[IEEE Region 8 Student Activities Official Website](https://r8.ieee.org/sac/)] project, I was solely responsible for the design and development of the site, enhancing its usability and functionality to better serve students across Region 8. The site was crafted to be a central hub, showcasing events, resources, and activities that connect students within IEEE's global network. I utilized modern web development tools to ensure an engaging user experience and seamless navigation, keeping the layout visually appealing and responsive across devices.
